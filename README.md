* [Assignment 2](Assignment_2) - simple CNN on the CIFAR-10 dataset
* [Assignment 3](Assignment_3) - fine-tuning, advanced augmentation on Standford Cars dataset
* [Assignment 4](Assignment_4) - RNNs on KTH-Actions dataset
* [Assignment 5](Assignment_5) - Conditional VAE on SVHN dataset
* [Assignment 6](Assignment_6) - DCGAN on Fashion MNIST and CelebA datasets
* [Assignment 7](Assignment_7) - TriNet Siamese model on "Labeled Faces in the Wild" (LFW) dataset
* [Assignment 8](Assignment_8) - semantic segmentation with U-Net on Cityscapes dataset
