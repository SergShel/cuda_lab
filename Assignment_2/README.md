### Assignment 2

Tasks:

<ol>
  <li>Train and compare the MLP from Assignment 1 and a simple CNN on the CIFAR-10 dataset (available in PyTorch) with somewhat optimized hyper-parameters</li>
  <li>Visualize several convolutional kernels and activations from the first two convolutional layers</li>
  <li>Train CNNs without regularization, with L2-Regularization, and with L1-Regularization. Compare the results: training and validation loss, accuracy, ...</li>
  <li>Train model with and without data augmentation. Compare the results: training and validation loss, accuracy, ...</li>
  <li>Bonus task:</li>
  * Implement and use your own custom learning rate warmup and learning rate scheduler criterion to avoid overfitting
</ol>
