### Assignment 1

Tasks:

<ol>
  <li>Train and Evaluate an MLP Classifier on the FashionMNIST dataset using PyTorch</li>
  <li>Draw learning curves (train/eval loss, train/eval classification accuracy) and confusion matrix</li>
  <li>Use Optuna to optimize (at least) two hyper-parameters (e.g, number of layers or hidden dimension) and show me some nice optimization plots :)</li>
  <li>Visualize the norm of the gradients for some parameters during training, i.e., how the error decreases for some parameters as the model learns</li>
</ol>

- assignment_1.ipynb - contains my solution for this Assignment. <br>
- optim_parallel.py - python script to run multiple optuna processes in parallel. <br>
- optuna_plots folder contains some optuna plots as png images <br>
